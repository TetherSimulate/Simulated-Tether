## Simulated Tether (USDT) Ecosystem

This simulated research token serves as an advanced educational platform, meticulously designed to replicate stablecoin functionalities-including price dynamics, wallet interoperability, and exchange mechanisms-within a completely isolated testing environment. Currently operational on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with a Tron-compatible version in active development.

## About Simulated Tether

### Stability
This simulated token is designed for research and testing purposes, with algorithmically controlled stability mechanisms to mimic real-world market behaviors. Unlike traditional stablecoins, it does not maintain a fixed peg, allowing users to study volatility patterns and economic models in a controlled environment.

### Global Reach
Deployed on BNB Chain, Ethereum and Tron, this experimental token enables cross-chain simulations for educational use cases.

### Liquidity
As a simulated asset, this token integrates with testnet liquidity pools and mock DEX environments to demonstrate trading strategies.
